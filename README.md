## This is a thread pool which use muti-threads to solve abundant tasks.<br>

## How to use
It is defined as a class,use<br>
ThreadPool threadpool(int initial_worker_number,bool lock_thread=false);<br>
to initial it.<br>
the thread will create initial_worker_number threads.If lock_thread is true, the thread pool willnot change the quantity of worker_threads.<br>

Use 
```C++
threadpool.submit(F&& Function,string Discription,short Importance) 
```
to submit tasks to thread_pool.<br>
*The Function must be packaged by lambda.The Discription must shorter than 72bytes.The higher importance it is,the faster it will run in the pool.* <br>
For example, if you wanna run a function1(),you can submit as following.<br>
```C++
threadpool.submit(\[=](){function1();},"Function 1",4);<br>
```
If the function has a return value, the threadpool will return a future<ReturnType()>,use following command to get it.<br>
```C++
auto result=threadpool.submit(\[=](){return function1();},"Fcuntion 1",4);<br>
result.get();<br>
```
*Attention,once use result.get(),and the task didn't finish,the thread will be blocked until the task finish.* <br>
submit_task--->thread_pool_running--->get_answer<br>
     |--->other_tasks--->answer.future----|---->other_tasks<br>
                              (blocked)<br>
The threadpool will dynamic change the working threads.<br>
If tasks'quantity is bigger than worker_threads'quantity,and the worker_threads'quantity is smaller than limit,the thread_pool will add worker_threads.<br>
If tasks'quantity is smaller than worker_threads'quantity,and the worker_thread'quantity is bigger than limit,the thread_pool will reduce worker_threads.<br>
<br>
However,you can use 
```C++
ThreadPool.add(remove)_work_thread()
```
to change the threads manually.It will return a bool if successful.<br>
Also the thread pool provide a log_save function.It will save the tasks the worker run.(However,some tasks might be loss.Because the worker runs too fast and didn't save)<br>
<br>
## Create your own thread pool
If you wanna create the threadpool which run in your want,you can create a derived class from ThreadPool.<br>
The worker_loop(for running thread),monitor_loop(for monitor_thread),Adjust_threads(for adjusting the quantity of threads dynamicly),Save_log(for saving the running logs) are all virtual function.<br>
<br>
You can visit Demo to check how to use the threadpool<br>
<br>
Really sorry that it can't run in VS-Studio which always cast errors while running.However,it works perfectly on Dev-C++ which use gcc.<br>
